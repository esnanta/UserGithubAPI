Submission Fundamental Android Training - Dicoding
Introduction

This repository contains the source code for an Android application developed as part of the Dicoding Fundamental Android training program. 
The project integrates various core Android functionalities to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

Key Features

    Search Functionality: Implements SearchView to enable users to search for data within the application.
    Tab Navigation: Leverages TabLayout for seamless navigation between different pages of the application, managed by ViewPager2.
    Network Requests (JSON): Utilizes both LoopJ and Retrofit libraries to perform network requests and handle JSON responses effectively.
    CRUD Database Management: Integrates SQLite and Room to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for application data persistence.
    Data Storage (Key-Value): Employs DataStore to store user preferences and settings with a key-value pair approach for data persistence and retrieval.

Prerequisites

    Basic understanding of Android development concepts (activities, fragments, layouts, etc.)
    Familiarity with Java or Kotlin programming languages

Setting Up the Project

    Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
    Open the project in Android Studio using the "Open an existing Android Studio project" option.
    Ensure you have the necessary development tools and libraries installed in your Android Studio environment.

Running the Application

    Connect a device or emulator to your development machine.
    Click the "Run" button in Android Studio or choose the appropriate configuration and run mode.

Project Structure

(Provide a detailed explanation of your project's directory structure, outlining the organization of code files and resources)

Explanation of Key Technologies

    SearchView: Explain how users can interact with the SearchView to initiate data searches and present search results within the application.
    TabLayout & ViewPager2: Describe how these components are used to create a tabbed navigation experience, where users can switch between different pages using tabs.
    LoopJ & Retrofit: Provide a brief comparison of these libraries for network requests, highlighting their strengths and use cases in your application. Explain how JSON responses are parsed and handled.
    SQLite & Room: Discuss the role of SQLite in data storage and how Room simplifies interactions with the database. Describe the implemented CRUD operations.
    DataStore: Explain the purpose of DataStore for storing and retrieving user preferences. Detail how key-value storage is utilized in your application.

Further Exploration and Customization

    Feel free to explore the codebase and modify it to extend functionalities or tailor it to your specific needs.
    Refer to the documentation of the utilized libraries (https://loopj.com/, https://github.com/square/retrofit) 
	for in-depth information and advanced usage patterns.
